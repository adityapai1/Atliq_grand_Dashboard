# üè® Atliq Grand Hotels Dashboard
## üìå Objective
To address the declining market share and revenue of Atliq Grand Hotels, we need to leverage the use of Bussiness and Data Intelligence. This dashboard aims to provide a detailed analytics dashboard for the hotels to provide a detailed and comprehensive information display. The dahboard implements this using the metrics of RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), Occupancy %, Successful Bookings, and Average Rating. The analysis will include week-over-week comparisons and allow for monthly and weekly data filtering. A consolidated view with drill-down capability by city and conditionally formatted revenue visualization will support strategic decision-making to improve AtliQ Grands' competitive position in the hospitality industry.
